## Linting

We use eslint and devreplay for linting our sources. You can run eslint across the sources by calling yarn eslint from a terminal or command prompt. You can also run yarn eslint as a VS Code task by pressing Ctrl+P (CMD+P on macOS) and entering task eslint.

To lint the source as you make changes you can install the eslint extension.
